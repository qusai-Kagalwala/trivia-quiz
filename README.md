## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.6 or higher installed on your system

### Installation & Running

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/qusai-Kagalwala/trivia-quiz.git
   cd trivia-quiz
   ```

2. **Run the quiz**
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

3. **Play the game**
   - Answer each question with `True` or `False`
   - View your score after each question
   - Get your final results at the end!

## 🎮 How to Play

1. Run the application
2. Read each question carefully
3. Type `True` or `False` (case-insensitive)
4. Press Enter to submit your answer
5. View immediate feedback and your current score
6. Continue until all questions are completed
7. See your final score!

## 🏗️ Code Architecture

### Classes Overview

- **`Question`**: Data model for storing question text and correct answers
- **`QuizBrain`**: Game logic handler managing question flow, user input, and scoring
- **Main Module**: Orchestrates the game by creating objects and running the quiz loop

### Key OOP Concepts Demonstrated

- 📦 **Encapsulation**: Data and methods bundled within classes
- 🔧 **Abstraction**: Complex logic hidden behind simple method calls
- 🎯 **Single Responsibility**: Each class has one clear purpose
- 🔄 **Method Design**: Logical separation of functionality

## 📝 Sample Questions

- RAM stands for Random Access Memory
- JavaScript derives from a later version of Java
- Ada Lovelace is often considered the first computer programmer
- HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language
- *...and 6 more!*

## 🌟 Learning Outcomes

Through this project, you'll understand:
- How to design and implement Python classes
- Object instantiation and method calling
